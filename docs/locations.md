# Adding locations

1. Open MyMaps:
   https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1UGUufFwlGg1qbSMTjqf8B6ajfwDgxfLh

1. Create a new place marker. Add the image filename to the description.
    ![Create a place marker](./locations-1-create.png)

1. Add a photo for easy reference. This will not be used by the embedded map,
   but it makes editing the locations easier.
    ![Add reference photo](./locations-2-photo.png)

1. Done. This is what the place marker should look like.
    ![Done](./locations-3-done.png)
